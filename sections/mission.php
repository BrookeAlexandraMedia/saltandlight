          <h4>"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.  Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.  In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."</h4>

          <div class="offset-top-35" style="font-size: 25px;">When Jesus told us, we are the “salt of the earth and the light of the world, He was giving us a picture of who we are supposed to be. It means that he wants us to improve the quality of life of those we meet each day. Jesus wants us to be salty, and he wants us to shine brightly. People around us should know for sure that we’re Christians. We should show them love and acceptance and tell them about God. <b>When families attend Salt & Light, it is our goal to share the love of Jesus and teaching them who He is.</b> We want to share His light!</div>
